</code></pre><p>This will <a href="../../ref/git#Merges">merge</a> our Problem Set 4 code with your previous
work. If you have any “conflicts” from prior problem sets, <a href="../../ref/git#Conflicts">resolve
them</a> before continuing further. Run <code>git push</code> to save
your work back to your personal repository.</p>
<p>You may also create a new <code>cs61-psets</code> repository for this assignment. Don’t
forget to enter your repository URL on the grading server.</p>
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>Our simple IO61 library performs I/O on files.
You will find the code in the pset directory in the file <code>io61.cc</code>. Our
version of IO61 is pretty stupid—it uses byte-at-a-time system call
I/O and is thus quite slow. Your goal is simple: <em>speed it up using
caching.</em></p>
<p>We also distribute several programs that use IO61. (The grading server has
some secret extra programs too, and it has tests that use our handout programs
in different ways.)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cat61</code> reads a file sequentially one byte at a time and writes
it to standard output.</li>
<li><code>blockcat61</code> is like <code>cat61</code>, but reads the file sequentially one
<em>block</em> at a time. Its <code>-b BLOCKSIZE</code> argument sets the block size.</li>
<li><code>randblockcat61</code> is like <code>blockcat61</code>, but it chooses a <em>random</em>
block size for each read and write. It still reads and writes
sequentially (only the block sizes are random). The <code>-b</code> argument is
the maximum possible block size. This may very well stress your
caching solution.</li>
<li><code>reverse61</code> reads a file a byte at a time <em>in reverse</em> and
writes the result to standard output.</li>
<li><code>stride61</code> reads its input file using a strided access pattern,
writing the data it reads sequentially. By strided, we mean that it
begins at offset 0, reads BLOCKSIZE bytes, seeks to position STRIDE,
reads another block, seeks to position (2 * STRIDE), etc. When it
gets to the end of the file, it jumps back to the first bytes not
yet read and repeats the pattern. The <code>-b</code> and <code>-s</code> arguments set
the block size and stride length, respectively.</li>
<li><code>reordercat61</code> reads its input file one block at a time <em>in random
order</em> and writes each block to the output file <em>at the correct
position</em>. The result is a copy of the input file, but created
non-sequentially.</li>
<li><code>scattergather61</code> can take two or more input files and two or more output
files. It reads blocks (or lines) from the input files in round-robin
order, and writes them to the output files in round-robin order. This will
test your ability to handle multiple input and output files.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are others.</p>
<p>You will introduce caching to the <code>io61_file</code> abstraction and use your cache
to speed up IO61 operations. We’re giving you tons of freedom to implement the
cache as you like. You may even use <a href="../../ref/file-descriptors">memory-mapped I/O</a>,
<a href="../../ref/file-descriptors">prefetching system calls</a> like <code>madvise</code> or <code>posix_fadvise</code>,
or multiple threads or processes <strong>(although none of these are required)</strong>.
But you <strong>may not</strong> use another buffered I/O library or caching I/O library.</p>
<p>Your library should:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return correct results</strong> for <em>all</em> access patterns and file types,
including multiple files, very large files, non-seekable files,
files that return short reads or accept short writes, mixtures of
calls (for instance, alternating <code>io61_read</code> and <code>io61_readc</code>), and
random accesses.</li>
<li>Perform as well as stdio on <strong>sequential</strong> reads and writes for
<em>any</em> files, including very large files (such as files that don’t
fit in memory) and non-seekable files.</li>
<li>Improve on stdio’s performance for <strong>some non-sequential</strong> access
patterns, such as simple strides or reverse access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Code will be graded based on performance on the grading server.</p>
<p>All your code for the main pset should fit in <code>io61.cc</code>.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>We will evaluate you based on your code’s performance relative to a version of
IO61 that uses stdio. That version is provided for you in <code>stdio-io61.cc</code>.
(You can build a stdio test with <code>make stdio-cat61</code> and so forth.)</p>
<p>Run <code>make check</code> to check your current implementation on a battery of tests
and print summary statistics at the end. The tests are divided into groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>correctness tests</strong> (tests C1, C2, etc.) stress-test your code for common
errors. Performance on these tests is not important. As always, add
assertions to your code, and we’ll give extra credit for tests of your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>medium-file sequential performance tests</strong> (tests MSEQ*)
perform sequential I/O on 5MiB files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>medium-file non-sequential performance tests</strong> (tests MNONSEQ*)
perform non-sequential I/O (e.g., reverse, random, or stride) on 5MiB files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>large-file sequential performance tests</strong> (tests LSEQ*)
perform sequential I/O on 64MiB files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>large-file non-sequential performance tests</strong> (tests
LNONSEQ*) perform sequential I/O on 64MiB files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>secret tests</strong> (tests SECRET*) are only on the grading server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Run <code>make check-TESTS</code> (e.g., <code>make check-seqperf</code> or <code>make check-seqperf1-3</code>)
to run selected tests.</p>
<p>We may update the tests during the pset release period. We may also run
additional tests during grading. In all instances, <strong>correctness matters
most</strong>. A program that runs quickly but incorrectly is worse than a program
that runs slowly but correctly.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>It’s easy in this problem set to design something too complex and get
yourself stuck. Avoid that problem by tackling the simple cases first.
Here’s a possible roadmap.</p>
<h3 id="phase-1">Phase 1</h3>
<p>You can improve the way <code>io61_read</code> and <code>io61_write</code> work <em>without introducing
a cache</em>. Use <code>strace</code> to investigate the operation of <code>blockcat61</code>. Look at
the <code>blockcat61</code> code; what system calls do you think it should make? Then run
<code>strace -o strace.out ./blockcat61 blockcat61.cc</code>. (That command line tells
<code>strace</code> to write its output to <code>strace.out</code>, so examine <code>strace.out</code> with a
command like <code>less strace.out</code>.) What system calls does <code>blockcat61</code>
<strong>actually</strong> make?</p>
<p>This will improve your performance on the block I/O tests (e.g., <code>make check-mseq2</code>). Also check that your code still passes the correctness tests
(<code>make check-c</code>).</p>
<blockquote class="note"><p>As you work on improving the performance of your code on sequential access
patterns, you may want to ignore non-sequential access patterns. This will
mean your code will produce incorrect results for non-sequential tests like
C12, C13, and C14. That’s OK as long as you fix it later!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="phase-2">Phase 2</h3>
<p>Implement a <strong>single-slot cache buffer for sequential reads</strong>. This will hold
bytes [N, N+B) of the file, where B is some largish number (try different
numbers). Any read request that lies within that range of bytes can be
satisfied without making a system call. Check your work by examining <code>strace</code>
output.</p>
<p>This will improve your performance on byte I/O tests (e.g., <code>make check-mseq1</code>).</p>
<p>After you've implemented your cache buffer for reading, consider a special
case for reading one character at a time from your cache in <code>io61_readc</code>. Can
we avoid calling <code>io61_read</code> if we only want to read a single byte?</p>
<h3 id="phase-3">Phase 3</h3>
<p>Extend your single-slot cache buffer to also support <strong>sequential writes</strong>.</p>
<p>This will improve your performance on byte I/O tests. If you do this well, you
should now match or beat stdio’s performance on all sequential I/O tests!</p>
<h3 id="phase-4">Phase 4</h3>
<p>Fix your code to handle seeks correctly (but not necessarily in a
high-performance way).</p>
<p>This should make your code produce correct results for all tests.</p>
<h3 id="phase-5">Phase 5</h3>
<p>Change your code to continue handling seeks correctly, but with good
performance for <code>reverse61</code>. For ideas, try running <code>strace</code> on the
<code>stdio-reverse61</code> variant. What does it look like stdio is doing?</p>
<p>This should make your code both roughly equal stdio’s performance and produce
correct results on all tests.</p>
<h3 id="phase-6">Phase 6</h3>
<p>Finally, it’s time to outperform stdio on some tests! Perhaps a bigger cache
buffer will outperform stdio; perhaps memory-mapped files will help. If you
have worked through the previous phases, you will have ideas of your own.</p>
<h2 id="hints-and-troubleshooting">Hints and troubleshooting</h2>
<p><strong>Read our <a href="../../ref/file-descriptors">file descriptors notes</a></strong> if you are confused
about file descriptor system calls.</p>
<p>You will likely need to change most of the functions in <code>io61.cc</code>.</p>
<p>Stdio is a well-written package! It is OK if you can’t <em>always</em> beat it,
especially for sequential I/O.</p>
<p><strong>Write your own tests!</strong> This will help you shake out bugs in your code,
particularly correctness bugs. What diabolical things can you think of to try?
You can add new tests pretty easily; just edit <code>GNUmakefile</code> and <code>check.pl</code>.</p>
<p>If a program using your library produces incorrect results, it can be hard to
figure out whether the problem is with reads, writes, or both. For instance,
perhaps your read cache is wrong, so the program is reading incorrect data; or
perhaps the write cache is wrong, so the the program is trying to write
correct data, but the data passed through to the kernel via system calls is
wrong. To distinguish these scenarios, you can use <code>strace</code> to check things
like file positions. You can also use the <code>read61</code>, <code>write61</code>, <code>blockread61</code>,
and <code>blockwrite61</code> programs. These behave like <code>cat61</code> and <code>blockcat61</code>, but
they use stdio for half their tasks. The <code>read</code> variants use IO61 for reading
and stdio for writing, whereas the <code>write</code> variants use IO61 for writing and
stdio for reading. If <code>cat61</code> and <code>write61</code> produce bad results but <code>read61</code>
on the same workload produces correct results, you can be pretty sure the
problem is with writes.</p>
<p>You may make a couple assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may assume that any file descriptor passed to <code>io61_fdopen</code> has
its file pointer set to 0 (the beginning of the file).</li>
<li>You don’t need to set the file pointer after every call to
<code>io61_seek</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add assertions in your code, since they can help you check correctness.
However, assertions do take time to check, which could leave your code at a
disadvantage relative to stdio. We will check the performance of your code
<strong>with assertions disabled</strong> by running <code>make NDEBUG=1 check-TEST</code>.</p>
<p>If your code is slow, consider (1) the system calls it makes and (2) its CPU
performance. For system calls, use <code>strace</code> to check: Is a mistake in your
code accidentally causing expensive system calls, such as many <code>read</code> calls
that read one byte each? For CPU performance, consider whether there are
functions that can avoid some extra work. It might pay off to have specialized
<code>io61_readc</code> and <code>io61_writec</code> calls, for example.</p>
<h2 id="make-targets">Make targets</h2>
<p>Your code <strong>must</strong> work correctly with sanitizers turned on (though it will
not be very fast). Run <code>make SAN=1 check</code> to check for errors.</p>
<p>To get an strace log for your code on a specific test, use <code>make STRACE=1 check-TEST</code>. The strace output will be stored in <code>strace.out</code>.</p>
<p>To run without running the stdio tests, use <code>make NOSTDIO=1 check</code>.</p>
<p>To run with one trial rather than multiple trials, use <code>make TRIALS=1 check</code>.</p>
<p>To compile without optimization (which might help you debug), run <code>make O=0</code>.</p>
<p>To disable assertions, use <code>make NDEBUG=1 check</code>.</p>
<h2 id="going-beyond">Going beyond</h2>
<p>If you feel ambitious, you might try changing your code to use memory-mapped
I/O when this is possible. Memory-mapped I/O is not always possible, though,
so your old block cache should be used for pipe files and other non-mappable
files. This should make your code beat stdio on some non-sequential I/O tests!</p>
<p>If you have additional time and feel even more ambitious, you can implement an
associative cache that holds multiple blocks and works for (a) non-mappable
files or (b) very large memory-mapped files. Something like this will get the
highest performance.</p>
<p>It is difficult and rewarding to implement an associative cache. You’ll learn
a lot! But design carefully so you don't make your other code more difficult
to read and maintain. In fact, you might try working on <a href="../../ref/git">a separate
branch</a> initially.</p>
<h2 id="turnin">Turnin</h2>
<p>You will turn in your code by <em>pushing your git repository to
github.com</em> and <em>updating <a href="https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/grade/cs61-2022/">the grading server</a></em> with your repository.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to fill out <code>README.md</code> and <code>AUTHORS.md</code>.</strong></p>
